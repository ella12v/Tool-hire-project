# Tool-hire-project

A comprehensive project has been developed to facilitate customers in the exploration and procurement of rental tools. 
This system enables users to seamlessly access and purchase tools for hire. The tool inventory is meticulously managed through a file-based system, 
providing customers with the convenience of reviewing both available tools and those currently on hire. (Univeristy Project)
